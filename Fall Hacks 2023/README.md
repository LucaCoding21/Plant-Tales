__Plant Tales!__ <br />Our project to a Plant guide for beginners looking for information on any plant!

__What It does__<br />
This is a Plant dictionary website that uses the Prenural API, it tells you the specific details of all the plants. The watering frequency, the sun light needed to take care and even where it exists in the earth! Once you open the website, it will show case 3 of our favorite plants, and you can hover your cursor over it to see small details. After you search you desired plant like "tulip" it will show you the top 3 results for tulips. Once you click it, It will pop up a detailed description on the plant.

__Technologies Used__ <br />
We used a combination of front-end web development technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to create the user interface and interactive features. We also leveraged an online API to fetch plant data and images dynamically



__What we learned__<br />
Designing the CSS and HTML of a website<br />
Getting data from a public API and displaying it.<br />
Coding around the DOM

__How we Built it__ <br />

__API Integration:__ We started by exploring and understanding the Perenual API, which serves as the backbone of our application. We obtained an API key and learned how to make requests to fetch plant data.

__Front-End Development:__ We created the user interface using HTML and CSS. This involved designing the layout, search bar, and plant result cards. We also designed the popup container for detailed plant information.

__JavaScript Functionality:__ The core functionality of the application was implemented using JavaScript. We wrote functions to make API requests, process the retrieved data, and update the content on the web page.

__Event Handling:__ We added event listeners to various elements on the webpage to handle user interactions. For example, users can search for plants, click on plant cards to view details, and close popups with a click.


__What We are Proud of!__<br>
First Hackathon! <br />
2 person group with only 12 hours.<br />
Even work between both members.<br />
Proud of follwing the design concept from creating a wireframe to coding it.<br />
Applying knowlege and creating something new out of it.<br />
